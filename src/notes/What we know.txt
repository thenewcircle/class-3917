What do you know about TDD
+ Write the test first...
+ Test as as you... along the way....


Why should we write tests
+ Verify our code actually works
+ Verify our code does what was intended. (Quality)
+ Repeatable so we discover when we reintroduce bugs later (regression)
+ Finding Bugs so End Users Are Happy (Quality)


Why don't we write tests
+ Bad habits
+ Laziness
+ Time Pressure
+ It's hard to go back and add tests later
+ We have a QA team to find bugs....
+ Job Security
